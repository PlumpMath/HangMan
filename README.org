* Hang Man
This is a command line hang man game. The UI is very rough. But the algorithm is highly optimized. 

* How to run
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lein deps
java -cp 'lib/*:src/' clojure.main src/run.clj
#+END_SRC

You also need a dictionary file called dict.txt.

You must use this one: http://www.wordfrequency.info/500k_words.asp
Then cut out the stuff at the top. The first few lines of dict.txt should look like: 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
22995878	the	at	169011
11239776	and	cc	168844
10246048	of	io	168743
#+END_SRC
